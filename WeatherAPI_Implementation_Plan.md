# Implementation Plan: Weather API Client & Data Handling

## Context
- Some files and classes (e.g., `WeatherApiClient`, `WeatherData`, `MainWeatherInfo`, `WeatherDescription`) already exist in the codebase with TODOs for students to complete.

---

## Task 1: Implement API Client
- Review the existing `WeatherApiClient` class.
- Identify and complete the TODOs for setting up UnityWebRequest GET requests to OpenWeatherMap.
- Ensure the request logic fits into the existing class structure.

## Task 2: Handle JSON Data
- Examine the existing `WeatherData`, `MainWeatherInfo`, and `WeatherDescription` classes.
- Complete the TODOs for adding JsonProperty attributes and matching the JSON structure.
- Use the existing classes for deserialization, filling in any missing properties or attributes.

## Task 3: Error Handling
- Check for any existing error handling logic or TODOs in the API client.
- Implement robust error handling where marked, following the structure and comments already present.
- Ensure all network and parsing errors are handled as per the TODOs.

---

**Note:**
This plan is designed to leverage the existing code and guide completion of the marked TODOs. No implementation is performed at this stage.
